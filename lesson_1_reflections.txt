Diff can be very helpful when we trying to find bugs. When bugs appeared after we make some 
modification to code, it's very likely that they are introduced by the modification we just
made. If we can quickly find all modification we make, it'll be convenient for us to debug
the code.

The history of a file will also be very useful when we are trying find when and what modification
are made during the histroy of the file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automically saved, like Google Docs does?
Automically saved version control, like Google Docs, could be too detaled and small. The good part of this is that you can have it for free.
The commit of Git provide more flexibility, which is very nice feature. But this flexibility could be misused.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because addition of a single feature might need modification to more than one file.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

We can use command "git log [filename]" to see the commit history of one file



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

With version control, you can roll back to one of the history state. This is very useful when you
want to find out which modification you made that introduce the error.


Now you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try to try to using Git for?

For a project.
